In this chapter, I develop a new account of what is distinctively ‘equitable’ about equitable rights. On this account, equity as an institution regulates the pathways to legal rights. A person who is on a completeable but as yet incomplete path to acquire legal rights is vulnerable to interruption triggering the forfeiture of her position. Courts of equity fulfill the role of the state to preserve the integrity of the legal order by regulating the pathways to rights. This account explains and unifies equity’s traditional domain—the cluster of doctrines and principles that originated in the courts of equity. It also provides the lens through which to understand equity’s concern with a special kind of injustice where a person suffers an interruption along the way to private rights.
