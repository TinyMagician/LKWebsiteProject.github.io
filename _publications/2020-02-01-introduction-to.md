The idea of ‘office’ in law operates in a vast legal doctrinal terrain ranging across private and public law. It has not, however, commanded the attention of legal theorists and philosophers in anything like the way that cognate ideas such as right, duty, power, and authority have over the last one hundred years. The aim of this symposium is to bring the idea of office in law into focus. Over two days in Toronto in June 2019, leading scholars in private law, public law, and legal philosophy met to examine the idea of office, both in isolation and in relation to ideas about norms and normativity, public and private domains, agency and representation, and law and the state.
