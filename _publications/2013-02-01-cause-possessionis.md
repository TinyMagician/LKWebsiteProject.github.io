This chapter argues that possession should not function as the linchpin of property at all. Instead, ownership combined with privity, force, and fraud get us what the relativity of title and its emphasis on possession are sometimes thought to provide. The chapter is organized into two parts. The first considers the special importance of the role of true owners in possessory disputes. It emphasizes the concept of ownership pro tem, which preserves the authority of owners by enabling a finder to slot herself into a role that is protective of the office of ownership. This concept of ownership pro tem does not, however, explain all the variety of rights to possess in the common law. Not all holders of rights to possess are owners pro tem. Someone who mistakenly assumes something is hers and someone who knows it is not but who asserts dominion over it anyway — i.e., a thief — both possess without deference to the authority of the true owner. What explains this other variety of right to possess, that of the wrongdoer? The second part argues that there is a second and distinct normative nexus that exists between a wrongdoer and a later possessor in some contexts. The ancient concept of privity explains this normative nexus.
