In A Liberal Theory of Property, Dagan combines a realist’s appreciation of the promise and perils of property with an analytical philosopher’s ambition to provide a systematic account of property law as a whole.Footnote1 As a realist, Dagan pays close attention to the relationship between property and power as well as to the relationship between property and a variety of valuable human relationships. And as an analytic philosopher, Dagan insists that property law as a whole has a single, unifying telos: empowering self-determination.Footnote2 Property contributes to our ability to author our own lives. It is impossible, Dagan tells us, to imagine a world committed to self-determination without it. On Dagan’s account, property’s telosFootnote3 explains the multiplicity of property types (too few would inhibit self-determination); its justification (property would lack legitimacy without this connection to us); and, finally, property’s inherent limits, derived from a commitment to reciprocal respect for self-determination or what Dagan (with Avihay Dorfman) calls ‘relational justice’: ‘[the] law does not confer property rights that authorize violations of reciprocal respect for self-determination’.Footnote4 All property types are designed to promote owners’ self-determination and are, at the same time, inherently limited to accommodate nonowners’ self-determination.
