In this chapter, I ask whether shares in corporations ought to command more attention within theories of property. Contemporary liberal property theorists typically take land (and sometimes goods) as the basic case of property. Shares tend to be left out of these accounts or treated as imitations or mutations of the basic case. Economists, for their part, have transformed the idea of ownership: 'owner' refers to the ultimate beneficiary of the value of assets. Shares are treated as a central case of property by those who take this approach. Shareholders are taken to own the corporation insofar as they are the ultimate beneficiaries of its value.
