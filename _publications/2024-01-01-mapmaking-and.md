‘Mapmaking and Law’s Legitimacy’ Over at least two decades, Stephen Smith wrote frequently about the concept of a legal ‘map’ and about the people who make them. The great mapmakers of English law, he told us in the early 2000s, were driven to show how legal doctrine could be explained in terms of abstract concepts. Their maps of English law did not just offer ways of processing massive amounts of legal data, they had a normative function too: they served core justificatory aims of the law itself, in particular its commitment to deciding like cases alike. Maps, for Smith, did more than provide directions to judges looking to classify legal doctrine in order to apply it consistently; in his words ‘A good classification does not just fit the data; it gives the data meaning.’ But what kind of meaning? Doctrinal meaning, certainly, but Smith also found moral significance in the maps we make, tying them to the justification of law itself. In this chapter, I want to examine how maps and mapping might relate to the morality and justifiability of private law. I will then raise three challenges to a ‘moral mapping’ view.
