**Abstrict**

Private law as a rule presumes we hold on to what we have. A principle of non-derogation from the grant seems to be at odds with this: far from presuming that grantors part with the least they could on making a grant, the principle generates the presumption that a grantor conveys all she has to give. In this paper I explain the principle of non-derogation from the grant in terms of an appointment of a successor to a position of authority, and so the ideal of a grant as a conveyance of the full authority associated with that position. Voluntarist as to whether a legal power is exercised, the law’s approach is rationalist as to the effects of its exercise, making sense of particular grants in terms of the ideal of a grant. This explains both why there is a strong presumption against change in our relations with others (and the demand for juridical reasons to explain any change) and at the same time, once rebutted, a presumption that the grant conveys what is reasonably necessary for it to operate as the appointment of another fully to that position of authority.
